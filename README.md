Analysis by Graam Liu

I worked individually so the entire project is solely my own. In terms of the dataset, I chose a movie ratings dataset that encompassed over 25 M reviews across many types of genres, spanning from the 19th century up until 2019. I chose it because I have worked in the film and television industry and was curious on the overall trend in people’s perception of entertainment through the years. In addition, I have never worked with such a large dataset and wanted to challenge myself. Challenges included mostly cleaning the dataset. The data was split among several csv files, so I had to find the correct key to do a left merge and combine the interesting datasets into one: the joined files focused on movie ratings and movie titles. The largest challenge was separating the year the movie was made from the movie title when it was contained in one column. I had to research various panda string methods and look up the documentation to make very specific adjustments such as .rplit() to ensure that only one specific character was split on (‘(‘) in order to make another column. In addition, there were challenges of copying temporary dataframes in order to edit my original dataframe. The method that the pandas documentation recommended was .loc() in order to keep the rows and columns intact without simply making a copy. Once the data was cleaned and could be analyzed, it become clear that average movie ratings leveled of and begin dropping after the 1980’s. Further research could be done and possibly a correlation with the emergence of sequels and less original content should be researched further. Looking at the standard deviation, there was a slight rise in disagreement among viewers in terms of rating, which might be attributed to growing tastes in new genres, where further research can be done. In addition, more datasets could be subset that focus on genre like comedy vs. drama vs. comedy and drama combined.
